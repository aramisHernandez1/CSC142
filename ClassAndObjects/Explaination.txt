Class is the blueprint of an object.
The big idea of how an object will behave.

Object: Is an entity that combines states and behaves.
It is a instinces of the class. 

When you have something like

Food pie = new Food();
new means create an object in memory. And return object's memory address
Two different objects are different because they have different memory addresses
But they could belong to the same class or "blueprint".
